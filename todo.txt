Use shared libs instead of static
Use assimp, SDL and freetype submodules instead of tar
Handle -j flags correctly
Build freetype without harfbuzz, it does not compile if the user does not have it.
Dont push the .SLN in notrealengine but generate it
Does not work on WSL when SDL audio can't init -> Add compile options to choose what to init
Segfaults when closing (on WSL)
