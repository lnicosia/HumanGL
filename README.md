## Introduction

Following [scop](https://github.com/lnicosia/scop), the first OpenGL project from 42, the students must now code their own vector and matrix library to implement hierarchical models and solid animations.

## Technologies

This simple program is coded in C++ with the OpenGL API. The engine is written in an external [Not real engine](https://github.com/lnicosia/notrealengine) library for flexibility. Check its repository for more information.

## Features

### Models
The application can be launched without input file. Only the hard coded assets will be present: 4 cube-constructed characters with small specificities:
* Bobby - The most basic character, made of 1x1x1 cubes (with transformations). It fulfills the mandatory part of the 42 project.

* BobbyPlus - Just like Bobby, it is made of 1x1x1 cubes. But this time, the character has more members.

* Roundy - Same as Bobby but made from spheres instead of cubes.

* RoundyPlus - Judy like BobbyPlus to Bobby, roundy plus is made of spheres but has more members.
